I've never done this before, as to say express myself through text format on a platform known to about 6-7 entities, some of which are actually human and I 
pretend to know what its all about. If you want to read to relate then this probably isn't your final destination nor is it if you wanted to read about what you think
made to sound plausible in a realistic scenario where your amazing thoughts could change no... Dominate the world stage obliterating the ideals which you 
perceive as bad. However, if your in the small minority whereby those normal day to day tasks that have been numbingly and mindlessly completed countless times
throughout the course of time, and they start to seem a bit pointless then this may just be for you. If those thoughts like maybe, just maybe the toilet paper enjoys nay,
passionately yearns to gyrate the other way and that convention just has to sit in the corner and learn to live with dictating only the colour and material... 
Stupid puppies, honestly they don't need to kiss my arse. At some point it does begin to feel like an abusive relationship. Or even thoughts like those ones that
force you into a panic attack because some other human, has by all means tried hard but failed dramatically to put together a joke either because it fell short of
actually being considered funny even to the over complimentary crowds of stand up comics... Because lets face it, who actually finds something that funny unless 
their secretly trying to prove something. Or in fact it was just a joke they found so profound that it needed to be shared at this precise moment and yes, with that
exact flavour or terrible timing, now this situation is bad enough when you watch someone else suffer through it but having to pretend to laugh out of pity just so
the situation ends feels like blackmail... Laugh at me or I'll continue to stare at you until my eyes burn holes of unbridled need for validation into your uncaring face.
Can we not live in a world where we can efficiently say that joke was bad without ruining someone's life, without their self esteem plummeting into the sea on their next
bowel movement, and if this scenario was to come to fruition I can imaged that bowl movement being 5 seconds after you finished your soul destroying sentence. No, of course
this is not how we do things, instead the attacker or joke teller gets a very well managed and maintained standard laugh that has been tried and tested to be exactly 50% 
"This is not funny, why has every decision I have ever made lead to this situation" and 50% "This bastard has forced a positive emotional response to a situation that could
not be more bloody negative and yet It has to seem authentic".

If you found the above generally quite optimistic about the general decline of man kind, I'm sorry. However if like me you find the above a glaring statement of the failures
to deal with life and therefore are subjected to a multitude of rules set by no one and his mum then this may be... Just may be for you.

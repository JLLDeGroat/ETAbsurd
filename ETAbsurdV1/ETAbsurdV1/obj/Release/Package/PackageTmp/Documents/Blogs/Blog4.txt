I tried to watch a film last night with the wife. A film by most account a self gratuitous fan fest about people
fighting over centuries for their five a day. However as much as assassins creed fulfilled my need to see people get 
killed in maticulously calculated choreographed set pieces. It was a side attraction to its underlying message which fueled a 2 
hours debate you humans abilities to choose. 

Free will is generally thought as the unuqie abilities for a human to choose his own path, however it goes further than that,
to the fringes of moral responsibility and an actions consequence. So as much as my optimistic personality tries to convice me
that I chose, and only I chose to laugh at the rediculous joke told the other week... I simply did not, if I actually did do 
that to myself I'd ask to be straight jacketed. So imagine the many decisions you have, with that illusion of free will looming
over with a smile as fake and disturbing as Ronald Mc'Donald's during a kids party. You go to make the decision only to find out
you have been manipulated/forced or unexpecedly possessed into a certain path. Does this empower or belittle you? Do you feel 
that beucase theres no definitive way to confirm whether or not the decision was yours alone that you would be incapable. Or does
it make you stronger by taking away responsibility allowing you more options to cause consequences with decisions made by other people.

So next time you make a decision ask yourself whats forcing you to, and that possibly free will can be excersised by not making a decision at all.

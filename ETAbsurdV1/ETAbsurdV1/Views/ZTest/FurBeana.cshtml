            Sooooo... This is really the childs time to shine, so considering their best efforts to explain the images your about to see...
            Most of it is my interpretation and asking questions resulting in very badly grouped words that dont really mean much.

            This one needs no explanation at all, although the journey to it probably does. Guiding featureless he sketched what was to be a heart,
            HOWEVER, when he finally got round one side he decided to draw a rock... So you are rock mummy which kinda looks like a bean. THEREFORE...
            <br/>
            I DUB THEE BEAN ROCK MUM OR BROCK MUM ORRRR BRUM.

            This one was done by, wait you have a second to guess...
            <br/>
            HARRISON woop, he started out saying mumbled words, saying mummy every so often... Then when he finished, I asked and he told me it was an
            airplane. I don't know how to make this out to be a mothers day gift however, maybe you make him fly in a squiggly jumbo jet :D.

            There was no explanation for this one, Carmine with Harrison giving instructions drew this, one said it was fruit... The other said Dadan.
            I'll let you figure out which said which.

            All that was left to see was that they love you bean, in their own weird and bumb to the face kinda of way. The way that means they slap
            there face into the bed laughing at my pops, constantly... RELENTLESSLY, unstoppably asking for food. 
            <br/>
            The way they say Okai mummy when you ask them to finish their waffles, chicken and cheesy puffs. The way harrison runs way every god dam time
            at bum change time, or laughing as he pours water on the floor.
            <br/>
            the way carmine, the bloody master criminal, the rasputin... Whispering in harrisons ear, do this myahahaha... Touch those plugs, open mummys
            art case... THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND and jump off the sofa.
            <br/>
            All these, and many more are they weird ways they love you for not for you they could not.
